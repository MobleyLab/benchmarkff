# Sets of molecules used here, and auxiliary data/tools

- `visualize_final_set.ipynb`: Notebook for visualization of final set of molecules; generates PDF in `molecule_PDFs`
- `issues`: Molecules which were removed from analysis due to various types of failures
- `set_v01_initial`: Set of molecules used initially
- `set_v02_six_ffs`: A trimmed version of `set_v01` which removes molecules associated with parameterization or other failures (see `issues` directory)
- `set_v03_non_redundant`: A trimmed version of `set_v02` which removes molecules used for training OpenFF 1.2 (the ones in set_overlapping). This provides the final set used in our study.
- `set_overlapping`: Provided by Hyesu Jang, molecules which were removed from this set when we began benchmarking OpenFF 1.2 as they were included in the OpenFF 1.2 training data.
- `molecule_PDFs`: Visualization generated by notebook
